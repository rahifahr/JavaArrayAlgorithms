# JavaArrayAlgorithms
Java implementations of array-based algorithms for pair sums, unions, and intersections, including efficiency optimizations.

# Array Algorithms in Java

This repository contains Java programs developed as part of a coursework assignment focused on array-based algorithms, including pair sum detection, union, and intersection of arrays.

## Files

- `PairFinder.java`  
  Contains methods to find all pairs in an array that sum to a target value. Includes a simple O(n²) approach and a more efficient O(n log n) approach using sorting and two-pointer technique.

- `MergeApproach.java`  
  Contains methods to compute the union and intersection of two integer arrays. Duplicates are handled, and arrays are sorted to improve efficiency.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Array manipulation and traversal
- Sorting algorithms (selection sort, quicksort)
- Two-pointer technique for efficient searches
- Algorithmic complexity (O(n²) vs O(n log n))
- Defensive programming (handling null arrays)
